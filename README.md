**Welcome to the Poetry Paradise!**

    There are people who enjoy reading poetry, and there are some who write their own pieces, which, unfortunately, never 
    get published. As a result, many poems fail to reach interested audience and make their impact on readers’ lives.
    
    The purpose of our project is to create a web platform that would allow people not only access famous/classic poems 
    online, but also post their own compositions, receive feedback from others, edit someone else’s work, translate poems 
    into their own languages (to expand the audience), or simply enjoy reading master pieces of art from talented people 
    around the globe.
    
    Enjoy the Paradise!
